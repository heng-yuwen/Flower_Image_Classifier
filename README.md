# Flower_Image_Classifier by Udacity
## Project Description
In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch for 102 flower categories, then convert it into a command line application.

The project is combined with 3 parts:

1. Load and preprocess the image dataset;
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset;
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content;

## Main files
The main code of this project is in the file [Image Classifier Project.ipynb](https://github.com/hyw1994/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/master/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb)

The command line training application code is in the file [train.py](https://github.com/hyw1994/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/master/train.py)

The command line predict application code is in the file [predict.py](https://github.com/hyw1994/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/master/predict.py)
