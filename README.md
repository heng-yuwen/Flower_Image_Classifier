# Flower_Image_Classifier by Udacity
In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch for 102 flower categories, then convert it into a command line application.

The project is combined with 3 parts:

Load and preprocess the image dataset;
Train the image classifier on your dataset;
Use the trained classifier to predict image content;

The main code of this project is in the file [Image Classifier Project.ipynb](https://github.com/hyw1994/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/master/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb)
